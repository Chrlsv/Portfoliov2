            <p>My name is Charles Vargas, I am currently employed at Purolator as a Data Reporting Analyst working on systems such as BI, Qlikview, Excel/VBA and SAP. My job consists of generating reports on an adhoc, daily, weekly and monthly basis - generate over 500+ reports on a periodic basis - to clients. These requests could vary as they could ask for an array of data that needs to be specific for their need and must be analyzed accordingly. Furthermore, we optimize these reports by automating them in order to save time</p>
            <p>Previously, I was also a Financial Analyst for Kik Custom Products utilizing 4 ERP systems such as JDE Enterprise one, JDE Worlds, SAP and Concur. My responsibilities consisted of overlooking internal expenses and auditing multiple accounts. </p>
            <p>I aspire to become a developer one day; creating creative applications that other people can utilize in their everyday life. On my free time, I have multiple hobbies such as; gym, guitar and computer games. </p>
